        <p class="paragraph 1" id="first-p"> I was born in montreal in 1995. I lived in the area for 7 years until

            I moved to missisauga with my mom and brother. After a couple years,

            we moved to Innisfil, Ontario, where I spent most of my formative years.

            I went to a French Catholic highschool where I met my best friends

            who i still keep in touch with daily, all thanks to modern techonology. (aka Discord and video games)

            After highschool, I did a semester of the electrical technician course but unfortunately dropped out as

            the dangers of it intimidated me. If I could go back, I would of kept with it as I would be

            much better off now financially. Although, they say forsight is 20/20.

<p class="paragraph 2" id="p2">After I dropped out, I worked at a factory for a few months and then did

            Stucco for homes for about a year. After that, I moved to Fort Mcmurray, Alberta, in search

            for a well-paying job. I was working in fast-food while I was

            waiting on a Union list. Before i was able to secure a good job,

             my cat and I had to evacuate for 3 months

            due to the forest fires that ate a good part of the neighbourhoods surrounding

            the City. We fell inlove with Vancouver Island and lived

            in Nanaimo for a bit over a year's time. (sadly, I didnt try the Nanaimo bars)

<div class="Clearfix">
        <p class="Paragraph 3" id="p3"> I moved back to Ontario and completed police foundations

            at Georgian College in Orillia. I then worked as a security guard

            at Georgian College for a year and a half. I realised that I did not

            want to pursue that career for several reasons and moved to Midland where

            I worked for Tay township and then the City of Midland in the Operations department.

            After seeing the success my friends were having in the tech industry,

            I decided to pursue an education in programming as I have always been

            passionate about computers and how they work. I've experienced many different

            fields of work such as Construction (siding, large-scale Framing), Kitchens, Customer service,

            city operations, landscaping, security, duct cleaning, and a few different types of factories. I am
            hoping that i find my place

            in the tech industry as it is a constantly evolving environement, contains problem solving,

            and is a part of of almost everything we encounter today. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
        
            It honestly blows my mind everytime i think that all this techonology that we take for granted came from

            ingenious men and women who put some metal and plastic together and told it to do things.

            I look forward to the many things you have to teach us this semester!
